# Applied Statistics in R Homework

This repository is a collection of my homework assignments for the Applied Statistics course, completed using R. It contains a combination of R code, data files, graphs, and theoretical explanations to demonstrate my understanding of various statistical concepts.

The contents of this repository include:

- **R Scripts:** These are the code files containing my solutions to various statistical problems. These scripts often include data preprocessing, statistical calculations, visualization, and interpretation of results.

- **Graphs:** Visual representations of data and statistical analyses created using R's plotting capabilities. These visuals help illustrate the findings and insights gained from the analysis.

- **Theoretical Questions:** Answers and explanations to theoretical questions related to statistical concepts and methods as required by the homework assignments.

By organizing my work in this repository, I aim to showcase my proficiency in both the practical and theoretical aspects of applied statistics while using R as my primary tool.
